# Intro to the Qordoba iOS SDK 


Qordoba's SDK enables agile, intelligent internationalization for native iOS applications. Benefits of localizing via an SDK versus file-based methods include:

* Improved QA for your app, in less time
* Live renderings of your screens for your marketing and localization teams (no code required)
* Easy, dynamic maintenance of content in your app (without re-submitting to the App Store)
* Happy, engaged international users (since we all know when an app has not been well-localized)


### Installation

To use the SDK, you'll need the following:

* Xcode version 7.0 or later
* A sandbox key, production key & application ID from the Qordoba web application
